# self-driving-car-with-build-from-scratch-neural-network

This program uses a neural network built from scratch with JavaScript. The neural network will be trained and teach a car how to manuever around other cars.
Using raycasting as five sensors that will take input and go through a neural network that will then learn and output new weights to eventually teach it to avoid cars.

## using the application
Try to teach the car first with one car and then saved the results. </br>
Increase the amount of cars next and repeat the same steps </br>
Eventually the neural network will learn from it and drive around the cars </br>
